# MASTER VISION

## What We Are Building

We are NOT building a surveillance system.
We are building India's first:

# Retail Intelligence Operating System

A software layer that transforms existing CCTV infrastructure into a business intelligence engine for Indian retailers.

The system should help retailers understand:

- Customer movement patterns
- Repeat visitors
- Billing conversion
- Peak business hours
- Product interest zones
- Queue behavior
- Customer intent trends
- Returning customer frequency
- Store performance analytics

WITHOUT storing personal identities or sensitive biometric data.

AI-Powered Retail Growth Intelligence Platform

## Market

Indian SMB Retailers

## Target Businesses

- Fashion stores
- Cafes
- Salons

- Quick-service restaurants

---

# PRODUCT GOAL

Create a plug-and-play SaaS platform that works with:

- Existing CCTV cameras
- Existing DVR/NVR systems
- Existing IP cameras
- Existing billing systems

The retailer should not need to purchase expensive new hardware.

---

---

## 6. Event Generator

Generate structured events:

Example:

{
  "track_id": "A102",
  "camera_id": "CAM_01",
  "event": "entered_billing_zone",
  "timestamp": "2026-05-06T10:22:31",
  "dwell_time": 45
}
